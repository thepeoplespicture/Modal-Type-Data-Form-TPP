Project Handover Brief: User input form for The Peoples Picture Overview We have been working on updating the form for The People's Picture website. The updated form ensures that users read the terms and conditions before submission. Due to the requirement for precise control over visual elements, Helen has decided to provide a detailed layout to follow for further development, this is the point where the project was halted as per Helens request. Code Structure The code utilizes Bootstrap 4.3.1 for styling and layout, following the conventions and practices of the framework wherever possible. IDs and class names follow a logical and human-readable pattern, sticking closely to the naming conventions provided in the original template from the development team. Functionality ● Basic Input Handling: The form includes several standard input fi elds for user data collection. ● Terms and Conditions Enforcement: Initially, the submit button and terms checkbox are disabled. Users must read the terms and conditions before these elements are enabled. Attempting to submit the form prematurely triggers a popup alerting the user. ● Modal Windows: Two modal windows are implemented - one for messages and another for terms and conditions. The latter tracks if the user has scrolled to the bottom to ensure they've presumably read the content. External Dependencies All libraries and external resources are carried over from the original template. The development team should ensure that any older libraries or external stylesheet calls that might override the new styles are appropriately managed or removed.
Development Environment ● IDE: Visual Studio ● Local Server: Open Server ● Version Control and Testing: GitHub, with tests conducted both locally and on the live website Known Issues No specifi c issues are known at the moment, but thorough testing will be necessary once the development team starts integrating and implementing the updated form. Future Enhancements Consider a more streamlined approach to terms and conditions acceptance, such as a forced popup on page load with a scrollable terms section and an acknowledgment button at the bottom. Any such enhancements should be fully approved before implementation.
